    <p>Search MDN by simply having "mdn" among your Google search terms. For example, "insertBefore mdn", "MDN indexedDB" or "assertions mdn regex". The rule is that "mdn" should be separated from adjecent text with at least a space character. The "mdn" is matched case-insensitvely, so "MDN abortsignal" works just as well as "mdn abortsignal".</p>

    <p class=note>
        <strong>Note:</strong>
        If the article is not what you were looking for, you can just search MDN itself or omit "mdn" from your next search term.</p>
    <p>

    <p>If you're trying to Google something that has "mdn" in it but you don't want to find it on MDN, then you can either misspell MDN or make sure there's a non-space character stuck to the "mdn" part (e.g. "what is your favorite mdn$ page reddit").</p>
