        <p>Search MDN by simply having "mdn" among your Google search terms. For example, "insertBefore mdn", "MDN indexedDB" or "assertions mdn regex". The requirement there is that a space separates the "mdn" from the rest of the query. It will not care about capitalization, so "MDN abortsignal" works just as well as "mdn abortsignal".</p>

        <p class=note>
            <strong>Note:</strong>
            If the article is not what you were looking for, you can just search MDN itself or omit "mdn" from your next search term.</p>
        <p>

        <p>If you're trying to Google something that has "mdn" in it but you don't want to find it on MDN, then you can either misspell MDN or make sure there's a non-space character stuck to the "mdn" part (e.g. "what is your favorite mdn$ page reddit").</p>
